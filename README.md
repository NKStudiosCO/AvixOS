# Avix OS 2.0
This is an Operating System that is fully ready. It can run old MS-DOS programs but has a advanced user interface (GUI). This is the 32 bit version that has faster and better proccessing while having its own programming language and many thing that windows today would have, even an internet browser. You can put these files on a floppy disk or a bland HardDrive to boot it up, even on modern computers as well! If you want to run it without booting it, you can use DosBox to do so. Just drag the BOOT.BAT file onto the DosBox Shortcut to boot it.
